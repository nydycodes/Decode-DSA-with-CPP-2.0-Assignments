POINTERS ASSIGNMENT

1.
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int a,b;
    cin>>a>>b;
    int *p1 = &a, *p2 = &b;
    cout<<(*p1)*(*p2)<<endl;
}

2.
option 1) p is a pointer and q is integer

3.
option 3) 11 10 11

4.
option 4) b gets value of a

5.
no, this code isnt correct as the pointer ptr is being assigned a integer value instead of the address of a variable
